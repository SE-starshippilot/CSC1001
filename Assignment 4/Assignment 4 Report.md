# Assignment 4 report

## Question 1

1. Code saved in [q4-1.py](q4-1.py)

2. The program recursively count the number of nodes within a singly linked list.

3. Input:

   - The user input is not implemented in this program.
   - User can insert nodes with `insert(data)` method. The `data` argument in this method refers to the value for the new node.
   - The recursive count is implemented by `recursive_count(node)` method. The `node` argument here refers to the starting position of the counting (in this case the head of the linked list).

4. Execute as following:

## Question 2

1. Code saved in [q4-2.py](q4-2.py)

2. The program  uses quick sort algorithm to sort a singly linked list in ascending order

3. Input:

   - The user input is not implemented in this program.
   - User can insert nodes with `insert(data)` method. The `data` argument in this method refers to the value for the new node.
   - The quick sorting is implemented by `quick_sort(node)` method. The `node` argument is the reference to the beginning position of sorting(in this case the head of the linked list).

4. Output:

   - Implemented by `out(node)` method. The `node` here refers to the starting node to output (usually the head of the linked list)

5. Execute as followings:

## Question 3

1. Code saved in [q4-3.py](q4-3.py)
2. This program outputs the steps to solve a Hanoi Tower with n disks
3. Input:
   - The user input is not implemented in this program.
   - The Hanoi Tower problem is solved by `HanoiTower(n)`. Parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of disks in the Hanoi Tower Problem.
4. Execute as following:
